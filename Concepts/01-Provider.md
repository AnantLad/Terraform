# Terraform Providers

## What is a Provider?

A **provider** in Terraform is a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with different platforms like:

- Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- SaaS services
- Other APIs

In simple words:  
**Provider = Connection between Terraform and a platform**

---

## Why Providers are Important

- They tell Terraform **where to create resources**
- Without a provider, Terraform cannot do anything
- Each provider offers its own set of resources

---

## Example: AWS Provider

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```
---

## Different ways to configure providers in terraform
There are three main ways to configure providers in Terraform:

### In the root module 

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

### In a child module

```hcl
module "aws_vpc" {
  source = "./aws_vpc"
  providers = {
    aws = aws.us-west-2
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  depends_on = [module.aws_vpc]
}
```

### In the required_providers block

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.79"
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

### Which One Should You Use?

- Beginner / Single provider → Root module
- Reusable code → Child module
- Version control → required_providers

# Required_Provider Configuration

The required_providers block in Terraform is used to declare and specify the required provider configurations for your Terraform module or configuration. It allows you to specify the provider name, source, and version constraints.

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = ">= 2.0, < 3.0"
    }
  }
}
```
